TLDR: How to build an interactive dashboard on Panel

Everybody loves a good dashboard. However, not everyone can afford to use Tableau or Power BI. Worry not, because Python has multiple libraries that allow you to create your own interactive dashboard easily, free of charge! One of these libraries is called Panel, which allows you to build an interactive dashboard via a Jupyter notebook. In other words, this module doesn't require extensive Python knowledge to create your dashboard.

I created my own dashboard in this repository using the world's CO2 data. My dashboard layout is inspired by the great [Thu Vu tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxiXOTKzfs&t=57s), which I highly recommend you watch to understand how to use Panel, with my own twist and flavor when designing the final dashboard. Here's a snippet of my dashboard:

With that said, have fun building your dashboard!
